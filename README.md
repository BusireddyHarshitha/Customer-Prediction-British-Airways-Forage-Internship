# Customer-Prediction-British-Airways-Forage-Internship
Project Name: Predicting Customer Bookings

Description: This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer will make a booking based on various factors. The model is trained on a dataset of customer bookings and uses a Random Forest algorithm to identify the most important features contributing to the prediction.

Key Features:

Predicts customer bookings using a machine learning model
Uses a Random Forest algorithm to identify key features
Analyzes various factors such as booking lead time, flight duration, passenger count, and more
Provides insights and recommendations for improving booking rates
Dataset:

Size: 10,000+ customer bookings
Features: customer_id, sales_channel, trip_type, route, booking_origin, flight_day, flight_hour, num_passengers, length_of_stay, booking_status
